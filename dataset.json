        "description": "\"Her Second ... His Third ... Their First!\", Giorgio Moroder & Chris Bennett's duet album was promoted. It was released just two months after the Munich Machine album - Moroder & Bellotte were fast workers! However, by now their audience were expecting hard-pounding disco tracks, and releasing a rather mellow title track as the European lead single (in the US Casablanca Records did not even bother to release a 7\") did not cut it. Love's In You, Love's In Me tanked, which is a shame when you have a gem like Love Now, Hurt Later on Side 2, begging to be released on a 12\" - and wasn't. Canadian singer Ann-Joy jumped at it and covered the song shortly after. Chris Bennett found more success when she collaborated with Moroder on the Midnight Express soundtrack album later in the year, singing the title track (which due to copyright blocks I cannot include here as planned). She wrote lyrics for Giorgio's 1979 productions with Suzi Lane, Munich Machine, and the Three Degrees, and also submitted a song for Tina Turner's Love Explosion album the same year before mostly withdrawing from the business. \n\n00:00 Love's In You, Love's In Me\n03:47 Keep It Together\n07:02 I Can't Wait\n11:32 Reprise\n16:35 Love Now, Hurt Later\n22:42 Burning The Midnight Oil\n27:30 Let This Night Go On For Days\n\nBonus Tracks:\n33:27 Love's In You, Love's In Me (Single Version)\n37:02 I Can't Wait (Single Version)\n40:55 Ann-Joy: Love Now, Hurt Later (1978 Cover)",

        "description": "D. Kashimoto, Vln.; G. Karni, Vla.; S. Gabetta, Vc.; N. Goerner, Piano. \n\n0:00 - Mov. I: Sostenuto assai - Allegro ma non troppo \n8:40 - Mov. II: Scherzo: Molto vivace - Trio I - Trio II \n12:15 - Mov. III: Andante cantabile \n19:09 - Mov. IV: Finale: Vivace \n\nIt is easy to understand why Schumann's Piano Quartet is often considered the younger brother to his Quintet: both share key signature, were composed during the same year, and the one seems to be a natural continuation of the other. Where the quintet is exuberant, full of contrasts and color, the quartet seems more concentrated, distilled. Counterpoint is arguably the focus of this work, and the themes are comparatively shorter than those of the quintet, which allows for a richer development. In many aspects, both works undoubtedly paved the way for the chamber music of Brahms, and this work's influence can be seen in the latter‚Äôs Piano Quartet in C minor, check for example the long, subdued introduction of both works with the bell-like tolling in the piano, or the extended cello cantabile in the slow movements. \n\nThe work opens with a serene introduction of long notes on strings, almost like a prayer. The main theme is right there from the beginning, in typical Schumannian form. After this introduction, the ensemble introduces the four-note motive followed by a long serpentine elaboration of the piano which forms the basis for the stately first block of the exposition, first on the cello over a pulsating piano accompaniment. The nature of the theme puts a natural emphasis on the second beat of the bar, a device which Schumann deliberately accentuates throughout the entire movement, and which forms the basis for the second theme, a rushing staccato scale. This new section is introduced rather abruptly, and on account of the inherent modulating quality of the theme, it is hard, not to say useless to allocate a tonality; notice the restless counterpoint in this section: the theme is inevitably presented with stretti imitations throughout the whole movement.\n\nThe scherzo is fleeting, almost Mendelssohnian, an obscure dance. In contrast to that the first trio, a direct augmentation of the main theme, is lyrical. Once again counterpoint is the main protagonist here, to such an extent that the harmony becomes so clouded, it becomes hypnotic. The second trio is a syncopated interlude, restless, interspersed with quotations of the scherzo. Once again one can hear future allusions of Brahms in this section.\n\nThe gorgeous Andante cantabile opens with a soaring aria for the cello, which is soon taken in counterpoint by the violin. A third statement of this melody is presented in a syncopated stream of eight notes by piano and viola, once again, a texture which Brahms will himself adopt later. After this gorgeous section, Schumann wonders us once again with a tender sostenuto interlude in the delicate, ephemeral key of G flat. The mood recalls the opening of the first movement. The harmonies and the prayer-like stillness recall oftentimes the sound of Mahler. Notice here again the twisted, often displaced rhythms in Schumann. The original first theme follows again, and then, a magical moment, as Schumann, recalling the stillness of the interlude, generates a coda out of a mysterious new theme. One by one all instruments share this theme under a low double B flat pedal by the cello, under Schumann's instruction to the player to tune his C-string down to B flat (advice often disregarded by players).\n\nThis new theme is the heart of the final movement: an hommage to counterpoint. The parallels between this movement and the final movement are obvious yet there is a slight difference: in the quintet, Schumman saves his strength for the final fugato where the original first theme makes a triumphant return, closing the circle. Here, the fugato is the opening statement, a clear manifesto on the side of Schumann. The writing is restless, agitated, exuberant, vibrant. A second theme, now lyrical, quintessentially Schummanian, appears in the minor mode in the cello, soon taken over by the rest. A third episode, which feels like a development section, ever-modulating, toils and turns in a manic manner until we reach the reexposition once again, and the cycle repeats. After a final surge, we reach a halt, and then the real fireworks begin, much like in the quintet. As always in Schumann, and to quote Richard Strauss: \"When you feel you've reached the limits of prestissimo, double the tempo\". Now all the instruments engage in a frantic contrapuntal debate, almost a quarrel. Once it feels everything is saturated, Schumann lets the music explode into a final rapture in the violin. The grace touch comes right at the end, as the cello melody makes one final appearance.\n\nCheck the fantastic live performance at the Hochrhein Musikfestival: https://youtu.be/sM9iSRm97Ws\nAll credit due to the fabulous performers, all ad revenue from this video may be freely redistributed to them.",

        "description": "(Victor) Recorded 4/15/1930 New York, New York. 28 West 44th St. Studio.  \n\nGrant Clarke (lyricist) \nHarry Akst (composer) \nBright lights [Motion picture] (Work title) \nGene Austin (vocalist : tenor vocal) \n\nBright Lights is a 1930 American pre-Code musical comedy film photographed entirely in Technicolor and produced and released by First National Pictures, a subsidiary of Warner Brothers. Although filmed in December 1929, the film sat on the shelf until the autumn of 1930 when it was given a limited release. However, Warners quickly withdrew the film when the studio realized that the public had grown weary of musicals. Warners believed that this attitude would only last for a few months, but, when the public proved obstinate, they reluctantly re-released the film early in 1931 after making a few cuts to it. The film stars Dorothy Mackaill, Frank Fay, Noah Beery and Frank McHugh. It also features the screen debut of John Carradine, who appears in a small uncredited role.  \nFrank Fay sung the song in the movie.\n\nGene Austin (June 24, 1900 ‚Äì January 24, 1972) was an American singer and songwriter, one of the first \"crooners\". His recording of \"My Blue Heaven\" sold over five million copies and was the largest selling record of all time. His 1920s compositions \"When My Sugar Walks Down the Street\" and \"The Lonesome Road\" became pop and jazz standards. \nAustin was born as Lemeul Eugene Lucas in Gainesville, Texas. \nAustin joined the U.S. Army at the age of 15 in hopes of being dispatched to Europe to fight in World War I. He was first stationed in New Orleans, where he played the piano at night in the city's notorious vice district. His familiarity with horses from helping his stepfather in his blacksmithing business also prompted the Army to assign Austin to the cavalry and send him to Mexico with General John Pershing's Pancho Villa Expedition, for which he was awarded the Mexican Service Medal. Thereafter, he served in France in World War I. \nGene Austin was an important pioneer crooner whose records in their day enjoyed record sales and the highest circulation. The Genial Texan ex-vaudevillian and would-be screen idol, Austin constitutes an underrated landmark in popular music history. \nAustin retired to Palm Springs in the late 1950s and was active in civic boards there until 1970. Income from his record sales allowed him to live comfortably the rest of his life. \nHe died in Palm Springs of lung cancer and was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. \n\nLyrics: \nAll the old gang that I once knew\nNow have left me two by two\nThe old neighbourhood don't look so good\nI'm so lonely by my only\nEach and every one it seems\nMeets the ideal of their dreams\nI've searched everywhere for my ideal\nNow I'm beginning to feel\n Nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm lonesome\nNobody sighs, nobody cries if I'm blue\nIt seems that night after night \nI sit alone and twiddle my thumbs\nBut still I keep right on hoping, keep the door open\nBut nobody comes\nAin't it a crime, kisses of mine are just wasted\nSince summer time, I'm thinkin' what'll I do, boo-hoo\nLike a plaything on the shelf, guess I'll have to play by myself\n'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm blue\n Nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm lonesome\nNobody sighs, nobody cries if I'm blue\nI sit at home constantly\nMy company is just the four walls\nBut still I keep right on hopin', keep the door open\nBut nobody calls\n Ain't it a crime, lovin' like mine is just wasted\nSince summer time, I'm thinkin' what'll I do\nWhen it comes to happiness, I must be a step-child, I guess\n'Cause nobody knows, nobody cares if I'm blue",
