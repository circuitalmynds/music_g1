Lyrics
I have a picture pinned to my wall
An image of you and of me and we're laughing, we're loving it all
Look at our life now, we're tattered and torn
We fuss and we fight and delight in the tears and we cry until dawn

Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start, let loving start
Hold me now, warm my heart
Stay with me, let loving start, let loving start
